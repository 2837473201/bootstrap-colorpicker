**Check the new  [3.0 version development status](https://github.com/mjolnic/bootstrap-colorpicker/pull/88)**
 
## Download
- For getting the source code download, clone or install it through `bower install mjolnic-bootstrap-colorpicker`

## Reporting
- For reporting issues, please provide an example using JSFiddle or similar to reproduce the issue.

## Contributing
- If you want to develop or fix the plugin, run `npm install` and `bower install` inside the plugin folder
- Do not modify dist files directly (they are autogenerated using grunt tasks) and don't forget to run `grunt` inside the plugin folder before commiting and requesting PRs. It is needed for regenerating the minified files. Pull Requests without updated minified files won't be accepted.
- Check that the index.html demos aren't broken (modify if necessary)
- Test your code at least in Chrome, Firefox and IE >= 10

Thanks =)
